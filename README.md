## Introduction

NOX is a purpose-built cyber threat intelligence engine designed for operators who require speed, operational security, and depth in a single cohesive framework. It is not a wrapper around existing tools — it is a fully async, plugin-driven intelligence platform with a strict separation between execution logic and source definitions.

| Capability | Detail |
|-|-|
| ⚡ **Async Execution Engine** | Massively parallel scanning across 124 intelligence feeds with no sequential bottlenecks and no blocking I/O. |
| 🛡️ **Guardian Engine** | Integrated OPSEC layer with automatic proxy rotation and SOCKS5 support. Fail-safe kill-switch halts all traffic if the transport circuit is unavailable. |
| 🧠 **Risk Scoring** | Dynamic 0–100 scoring with time-decay, source confidence weighting, password complexity analysis, persistence multipliers, and HVT detection. |
| 🔗 **Recursive Avalanche Engine** | Every discovered asset — username, email, cracked password, phone — is automatically re-injected as a new scan seed. Per-asset pipeline runs sequentially (breach → crack → dork → scrape); child assets run concurrently. Identifiers from all four phases feed the pivot queue. Global deduplication and configurable depth cap prevent runaway recursion. |
| 🔍 **Autoscan** | Single command triggers breach scan + recursive pivot + dorking + paste scraping — fully automated, no manual chaining. |

---

## Features

| Feature | Description |
|-|-|
| **124 JSON Plugin Sources** | Every intelligence source is a JSON plugin. The execution engine contains zero hardcoded source logic. |
| **Async Core** | Full `asyncio` event loop with JA3 fingerprinting, SSL session management, per-request jitter, and configurable concurrency. |
| **Autoscan Pipeline** | `--autoscan` triggers: breach scan → recursive pivot → Google/Bing/DDG dorking → paste/Telegram scraping — all in one command. |
| **Recursive Avalanche Engine** | Every identifier discovered — from breach records, dork hits, or scraped paste/Telegram content — is re-injected as a new seed. Per-asset pipeline is sequential (breach → crack → dork → scrape); child assets run concurrently via `asyncio.gather`. A global `seen_assets` set prevents infinite loops. Concurrency and depth are fully configurable at runtime via `--threads` and `--depth`. |
| **Hash Pivoting** | Hashes found in breach data are automatically identified (MD5/SHA1/SHA256/NTLM/bcrypt) and cracked via concurrent background API queries. Cracked plaintexts are injected into the pivot queue as password-recycling seeds. Failures are logged silently — the scan never stops. |
| **Guardian Proxy Engine** | Zero-config OPSEC layer: reads `proxies.txt` if present; otherwise auto-fetches and validates a high-anonymity proxy pool in-memory. Full SOCKS5/HTTP/S and Tor support. |
| **API Key Rotation** | `api_key_slots` per source — NOX round-robins across multiple keys to bypass per-key rate limits. |
| **Identity Graphing** | Union-Find correlation engine unifies breach records into identity clusters across all sources, using type-aware pivot classification. |
| **Enterprise Forensic Reports** | Professional PDF/HTML/JSON/CSV/Markdown reports with Executive Summary dashboard (Total Time, Nodes Discovered, Cleartext Passwords, Pivot Depth), interactive Pivot Chain Visualization, and strict data sanitization — no technical noise in output. JSON exports are self-describing with a full metadata block. |
| **HVT Detection** | Auto-flags C-level, Admin, DevOps, and government domain accounts as High-Value Targets. |
| **Dorking Engine** | Passive document discovery via Google/Bing/DDG dorks with PDF/Office metadata extraction. |
| **Scraping Engine** | Paste site indexing, Telegram CTI channel monitoring, credential extraction, and misconfiguration discovery. Each autoscan asset gets a dedicated scrape session — no shared state. |
| **Proxy / Tor** | SOCKS5, HTTP/S proxy, full Tor routing via `stem`, and automatic Guardian fallback. SOCKS5 proxies are validated and routed correctly via `aiohttp-socks`. |
| **Secure Key Store** | API keys managed via `~/.config/nox-cli/apikeys.json` (chmod 0600). Unconfigured keys are silently skipped. Keys set via environment variable are picked up automatically without restarting. |
| **System Logging** | All scan events, phase completions, pivot discoveries, API events, rate-limits, and crack attempts are written to `~/.nox/logs/nox.log`. Only actionable intelligence reaches the terminal. |
| **Plugin Debug** | `--list-sources` prints a full operator debug table: plugin name, input type, confidence score, key status (configured / not configured / public), and any JSON parse errors. |

---

## Architecture

### Plugin-Driven Design

NOX operates on a strict separation of concerns: `nox.py` is a **pure, agnostic execution engine** — it handles async I/O, JA3 fingerprinting, SSL session management, recursive pivoting, and result correlation. It contains no hardcoded intelligence logic.

All intelligence is defined as **JSON plugins** in `sources/`. These plugins are the sole source of truth for what NOX queries, how it authenticates, and what it extracts. The build tool `build_sources.py` is the only authorised way to create or modify them.

```
build_sources.py  ──►  sources/*.json  ──►  nox.py (runtime loader)
   [Builder]              [Plugins]           [Execution Engine]
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **`sources/*.json` files are auto-generated artifacts. Never edit them directly.**
> All source additions and modifications must be made in `build_sources.py` and applied by running `python build_sources.py`. Manual edits will be overwritten on the next build.

#### Source Schema

```json
{
  "name": "MyPrivateDB",
  "endpoint": "https://api.myprivatedb.com/search?q={target}",
  "method": "GET",
  "headers": { "Authorization": "Bearer {MY_API_KEY}" },
  "regex_pattern": "([\\w.+-]+@[\\w-]+\\.[\\w.]+):([\\S]+)",
  "required_api_key_name": "MY_API_KEY",
  "api_key_slots": ["{MY_API_KEY}"],
  "input_type": "email",
  "output_type": ["username", "ip"],
  "pivot_types": ["email", "username"],
  "confidence": 0.9
}
```

Supported fields: `name`, `endpoint`, `method`, `headers`, `regex_pattern` (or `json_root` + `normalization_map`), `required_api_key_name`, `api_key_slots`, `input_type`, `output_type`, `pivot_types`, `confidence`.

---

### Autoscan Pipeline

`--autoscan` (CLI) / `autoscan` (REPL) executes the full intelligence pipeline in a single command:

```
For each asset (seed + every discovered identifier):
  ├─ Phase 1 — Breach Scan
  │     124 sources queried in parallel (async)
  │
  ├─ Phase 2 — Hash Crack (non-blocking, concurrent)
  │     Hashes found in breach data → rainbow-table APIs → cracked plaintext
  │     → password-recycling breach scan
  │
  ├─ Phase 3 — Dorking
  │     Google/Bing/DDG dorks → leaked docs, .env files, SQL dumps
  │     → new identifiers extracted and re-injected
  │
  └─ Phase 4 — Scraping
        Pastebin, IntelX, Telegram CTI channels → credential extraction
        → new identifiers extracted and re-injected

All identifiers discovered in phases 1–4 are re-injected as new seeds.
Child assets are processed concurrently via asyncio.gather.
```

`scan` (without `--autoscan`) runs Phase 1 only — breach sources, no pivot/dork/scrape.

---

### Recursive Avalanche Engine

Every identifier discovered during a scan — from breach records, dork hits, or scraped paste/Telegram content — is treated as a new intelligence seed. For each asset, the engine runs four phases sequentially: breach scan → hash crack → dork → scrape. Identifiers extracted from **all four phases** are harvested and re-injected as new seeds. Child assets are then processed concurrently via `asyncio.gather`.

```
target@company.com
  └─► [Breach] username: j.doe      ──► [Breach + Crack + Dork + Scrape]
  │         └─► github.com/jdoe     ──► [Breach + Crack + Dork + Scrape]
  └─► [Breach] hash: 5f4dcc...      ──► [AutoCrack] → "password123"
  │         └─► [Breach] password-recycling scan across all sources
  └─► [Dork] new@email.com          ──► [Breach + Crack + Dork + Scrape]
  └─► [Scrape/paste] admin@corp.com ──► [Breach + Crack + Dork + Scrape]
```

- **`seen_assets` set** — global deduplication; no identifier is ever processed twice, regardless of which phase discovered it
- **Global semaphore** — single shared concurrency cap across the entire discovery tree, respecting `--threads`
- **`--depth N`** — configurable pivot depth (default: 2); hard backstop prevents runaway recursion
- **`--no-pivot`** — disable recursive enrichment for a fast breach-only scan

---

### Hash Pivoting

When a hash is found in breach data during `--autoscan`:

1. Hash type is identified (MD5/NTLM, SHA1, SHA256, bcrypt)
2. Multiple rainbow-table APIs are queried **concurrently** in a background task
3. **If cracked** — plaintext is logged, the record is updated, and the password is injected into the pivot queue for password-recycling analysis across all breach sources
4. **If not cracked** — failure is logged to `nox_system.log`, the hash is preserved in the report, and pivoting on all other assets continues immediately

The crack process is fully non-blocking. A timeout or API failure never pauses the scan. Use `--no-online-crack` to restrict cracking to the local wordlist only (no data sent to third-party APIs).

---

### Guardian Proxy Engine

The Guardian Engine is NOX's zero-config OPSEC layer. It activates automatically when no `--proxy` or `--tor` flag is supplied.

**Resolution order:**

1. **`proxies.txt`** — if present in the working directory, NOX loads and rotates through the listed proxies.
2. **Dynamic fetch** — if `proxies.txt` is absent, the Guardian Engine fetches a fresh list of high-anonymity public proxies, validates each one, and holds the validated pool in-memory for the session. Nothing is written to disk.
3. **Direct connection** — if no valid proxies are found, NOX falls back to a direct connection and emits a warning.

> [!WARNING]
> Public proxy pools are inherently untrusted infrastructure. For sensitive engagements, always supply a controlled proxy via `--proxy` or route through Tor via `--tor`.

| Flag | Behaviour |
|-|-|
| `--proxy <url>` | Route all traffic through the specified HTTP/S or SOCKS5 proxy. Disables Guardian. |
| `--tor` | Route all traffic through Tor (requires `tor` service on port 9050). Disables Guardian. |
| `--guardian-off` | Bypass the OPSEC kill-switch and connect directly. |
| *(no flag)* | Guardian Engine activates automatically. |

---

### Reporting

All report formats include an **Executive Summary dashboard**:

| Metric | Description |
|-|-|
| Total Time | Wall-clock duration of the full scan |
| Nodes Discovered | Unique identities surfaced across all sources |
| Cleartext Passwords | Plaintext credentials found or cracked |
| Pivot Depth | Depth reached by the recursive avalanche engine |

Reports also include a **Pivot Chain Visualization** showing the full relational path from initial seed to final discovery:

```
[seed@corp.com] -> [LeakA / username:jdoe] -> [Dork: leaked .env] -> [new@email.com]
```

JSON exports include a `_meta` block with `scan_id`, `target`, `timestamp`, `nox_version`, and `pivot_depth_reached` — making every export self-describing for ingestion into case management platforms.

All output is sanitized — proxy errors, timeouts, and tracebacks are stripped. Only actionable intelligence is included.

---

## Prerequisites

- **Python 3.8+**
- **pip** (`python3-pip` on Debian/Kali)
- **Tor** *(optional)* — required only for `--tor`. On Kali: `sudo apt install tor -y`. The `tor` service must be running on port `9050`.

---

## Installation

### Option 1: Debian / Kali Linux — Isolated .deb (Recommended)

Download the `.deb` package from the [Releases page](https://github.com/nox-project/nox-framework/releases), then run:

```bash
sudo dpkg -i nox-cli_*_all.deb
nox-cli --help
```

The post-install script automatically:
1. Creates an isolated virtual environment at `/opt/nox-cli/.venv`
2. Installs all Python dependencies inside the venv (PEP 668 compliant — zero system pollution)
3. Builds the 124 source plugins
4. Links `/usr/bin/nox-cli` → `/opt/nox-cli/nox-wrapper.sh`

### Option 2: From Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nox-project/nox-framework.git
cd nox-framework
pip install -r requirements.txt
python build_sources.py
python3 nox.py
```

---

## Quick Start

**Step 1 — Build source plugins** *(from source only — .deb does this automatically)*

```bash
python build_sources.py
```

**Step 2 — Configure API keys**

`build_sources.py` creates `~/.config/nox-cli/apikeys.json` on first run, pre-populated with every supported service. The file is `chmod 0600` and is never committed to VCS.

This is the **single canonical key store** — all sources read from it at runtime.

```bash
# Edit the file directly
nano ~/.config/nox-cli/apikeys.json

# Or inspect plugin status and key configuration
nox-cli --list-sources
```

> [!NOTE]
> Any key set to `INSERT_API_KEY_HERE` or `""` is treated as unconfigured — that source is silently skipped. Sources without a key requirement are always active.
>
> **Load priority:** environment variable (e.g. `export HIBP_API_KEY=xxx`) → `~/.config/nox-cli/apikeys.json`

**Step 3 — Execute**

> [!NOTE]
> **OPSEC Kill-Switch:** By default, NOX activates the Guardian Engine (auto proxy rotation). Use `--guardian-off` to connect directly.

```bash
# Breach scan — input type auto-detected (email / domain / ip / username / hash / phone)
nox-cli -t target@company.com

# Full autoscan: breach + recursive pivot + dork + scrape
nox-cli -t target@company.com --autoscan

# Autoscan with Tor routing
nox-cli -t target@company.com --autoscan --tor

# Autoscan with SOCKS5 proxy + PDF report
nox-cli -t target@company.com --autoscan --proxy socks5://127.0.0.1:1080 -o report.pdf --format pdf

# Autoscan with custom pivot depth
nox-cli -t target@company.com --autoscan --depth 3

# Breach scan only — no pivot, no dork, no scrape
nox-cli -t target@company.com --no-pivot

# Domain scan
nox-cli -t company.com

# Hash identification and cracking
nox-cli --crack 5f4dcc3b5aa765d61d8327deb882cf99

# Hash cracking — local wordlist only, no third-party API calls
nox-cli --crack 5f4dcc3b5aa765d61d8327deb882cf99 --no-online-crack

# Password strength analysis
nox-cli --analyze "P@ssw0rd123"

# Google dorking
nox-cli --dork target@company.com

# Paste / Telegram scraping
nox-cli --scrape target@company.com

# Compare scan against last cached result — show only new findings
nox-cli -t target@company.com --diff

# Plugin debug: loaded sources, input types, confidence, key status
nox-cli --list-sources

# Force resync of source plugins from package
nox-cli --reset-sources
```

## Source Management

### Adding a Source

**1. Define in `build_sources.py`:**

```python
_auth("NewIntelDB", "breaches",
      "https://api.newinteldb.com/v1/search?q={target}", "GET",
      {"results": "$.results"},
      headers={"X-API-Key": "{NEWINTELDB_API_KEY}"},
      api_key_slots=["{NEWINTELDB_API_KEY}"],
      normalization_map={"email": "email", "password": "password"},
      input_type="email",
      output_type=["username", "ip"],
      confidence=0.85)
```

**2. Rebuild:**

```bash
python build_sources.py
```

> [!NOTE]
> The builder validates every source at build time: GET endpoints must contain `{target}`, volatile sources must have `reliability_score ≤ 4`, and the `confidence` field can be set explicitly to override the formula-derived value.

---

## Building the .deb Package

```bash
gem install fpm
bash build_deb.sh
sudo dpkg -i dist/nox-cli_*_all.deb
```
